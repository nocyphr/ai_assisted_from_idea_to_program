# Deciding on the Technologie(s)

Since I would like to create my idea in code, the question arises - what technology do I even want to use?

In my case this is what I decided on for a start (don't be too specific for now)

```
- I want to use Python to code
- I want to add the "behave" package (reason not relevant for this example)
```

And once again, you are done with this step. 

> If you don't know anything, just decide on the programming language you want to use. 

Optional:
> If you want to get fancy ask chatGPT or your preferred AI to give suggestions for the best packages to use for your idea
