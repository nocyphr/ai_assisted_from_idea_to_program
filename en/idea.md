# The Idea

We need an example, so since I am doing the final project for Harvards CS50P, lets use that. 

For my final project I choose to create a Texas Holdem Poker [CLI](Definitions/cli.md) program. 

```
program Texas holdem game (cli) 
```

That is all. No need to do more here, it is, after all, just an idea - not a full-blown blueprint.
